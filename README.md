# MinisterConnect Backend

This is the backend API for the MinisterConnect app, built with Django and PostgreSQL.

## Features
- Django 5.x
- PostgreSQL database
- Environment variable support via `.env`

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd ministerconnect_backend
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install django psycopg2-binary
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with at least:
```env
SECRET_KEY="your-very-secret-key"
```

To generate a secure secret key, you can run:
```bash
python3 -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'
```
Copy the output and use it as your SECRET_KEY value.

### 5. Configure the Database
Edit `ministerconnect_backend/settings.py` if needed. Default settings:
- Name: `ministerconnect`
- User: `devuser`
- Password: `devpassword`
- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `5432`

#### Setting up PostgreSQL locally on macOS
1. **Install PostgreSQL** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   brew install postgresql
   brew services start postgresql
   ```
2. **Create a database user and database:**
   ```bash
   psql postgres
   # In the psql prompt, run:
   CREATE USER devuser WITH PASSWORD 'devpassword';
   CREATE DATABASE ministerconnect OWNER devuser;
   \q
   ```
3. **Verify connection:**
   ```bash
   psql -U devuser -d ministerconnect
   ```

#### Verify PostgreSQL is Running and User Exists

- **Check if PostgreSQL is running:**
  ```bash
  brew services list | grep postgresql
  # or
  pg_isready
  ```
  If not running, start it with:
  ```bash
  brew services start postgresql
  ```

- **Check if the user exists:**
  ```bash
  psql -U postgres -c "\du"
  ```
  Look for `devuser` in the list. If not present, create it as shown above.

- **Check if the database exists:**
  ```bash
  psql -U postgres -lqt | cut -d \| -f 1 | grep ministerconnect
  ```
  If not present, create it as shown above.

Continue only after confirming PostgreSQL is running and both the user and database exist.

### 6. Run Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Verify Django Can Access the Database

After running migrations, you can confirm Django can read/write to the database:

1. Open the Django shell:
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell
   ```
2. In the shell, run:
   ```python
   from django.contrib.auth.models import User
   User.objects.create_user(username='testuser', password='testpass')
   User.objects.all()
   ```
   You should see a user object returned, confirming read/write access to the DB.
3. Exit the shell:
   ```python
   exit()
   ```

### 8. (Optional) Create a Superuser
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
You can then log into the Django admin at [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) once the server is running.

### 9. Run the Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the API or Django welcome page.

## Authentication (JWT)

This API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. You must obtain a token and include it in the Authorization header for all protected endpoints.

### Obtain Token

**POST** `/api/token/`

Request body:
```json
{
  "email": "user@church.org",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "refresh": "<refresh_token>",
  "access": "<access_token>"
}
```

### Refresh Token

**POST** `/api/token/refresh/`

Request body:
```json
{
  "refresh": "<refresh_token>"
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "access": "<new_access_token>"
}
```

Include the access token in the Authorization header for all requests to protected endpoints:
```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

## API Endpoints

### Candidate Profile (Automatic Creation & Update)

When a candidate registers, a draft profile is automatically created for them. Candidates can view and update their profile using the `/api/profile/me/` endpoint.

#### Get Profile (Requires Authentication)

**GET** `/api/profile/me/`

Returns the authenticated user's profile, including the invite code string and a URL to the uploaded resume (if any).

**Example response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,

  "city": "Lexington",
  "state": "KY",
  "zipcode": "40502",
  "status": "draft",
  "resume": "https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/resumes/GBR_RESUME.pdf",
  "video_url": null,
  "placement_preferences": ["Youth Ministry"],
  "submitted_at": null,
  "created_at": "2025-07-19T18:20:02.272847Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-07-19T18:37:23.310730Z",
  "user": 17
}
```

#### Update Profile (Requires Authentication)

**PUT/PATCH** `/api/profile/me/`

Updates the authenticated user's profile. Supports file upload for the `resume` field (PDF). Use `form-data` in Postman or your frontend.

**Example PATCH request body:**
```json
{
  "status": "pending"
}
```

**Example PUT request (form-data):**
- `street_address`: 456 New St (Text)
- `city`: New City (Text)
- `state`: NY (Text)
- `zipcode`: 10001 (Text)
- `placement_preferences`: ["Music Ministry"] (Text, JSON string)
- `status`: approved (Text)
- `resume`: (select PDF file) (File)

**Note:**
- The `resume` field will return a URL to the uploaded file (S3 in production, local in development).
- The `invite_code_string` field provides the human-readable invite code for display.
- First and last name are managed on the user object, not the profile.

### About Resume File Storage (AWS S3)

> **Resume files are stored in AWS S3 in production.**  
> In local development, files are stored on the local filesystem.  
> 
> **Why is the storage backend set directly on the model?**  
> Django determines the storage backend for file fields at the time the model is loaded (imported), not at runtime. This means that relying solely on the `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` setting can lead to issues in production environments (like Render) where settings may not be fully loaded before models are imported.  
> 
> To ensure that resume files are always stored in the correct location, the `storage` argument is set explicitly on the `resume` field in the `Profile` model:
> 
> ```python
> if settings.DEBUG:
>     resume_storage = None  # Use default (local)
> else:
>     resume_storage = S3Boto3Storage()
> 
> resume = models.FileField(upload_to="resumes/", storage=resume_storage, null=True, blank=True)
> ```
> 
> This guarantees that S3 is used in production and local storage is used in development, regardless of import timing or environment variable loading.

### Testing Profile Endpoints

- Unit tests for profile creation and update are in `api/tests/test_profile.py` and `api/tests/test_profile_me.py`.
- To test file uploads locally, ensure you are running with `DEBUG=True` and have the media static pattern in your main `urls.py`.
- In production, uploaded files are stored in S3 and the `resume` field will be an S3 URL.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure your `.env` file is correctly formatted and all required variables are set.
- If you change database settings, update them in `settings.py` and your local PostgreSQL instance.

## Testing

This project includes comprehensive automated tests for all API endpoints and functionality. Tests are organized by feature in the `api/tests/` directory:

- `test_church.py` — Tests for church creation and validation
- `test_user.py` — Tests for user creation and management
- `test_auth.py` — Tests for JWT authentication (token obtain/refresh)
- `test_invite_code.py` — Tests for invite code creation and listing
- `test_applicant.py` — Tests for applicant registration

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
make test
```

Or run specific test files:
```bash
python manage.py test api.tests.test_church
python manage.py test api.tests.test_user
```

### Test Coverage

The tests cover:
- **Success cases** — Valid data and expected responses
- **Validation errors** — Invalid input data and error messages
- **Authentication** — Protected endpoints and JWT token handling
- **Business logic** — Duplicate prevention, invite code usage tracking
- **Edge cases** — Missing fields, invalid formats, etc.

Tests use Django's test framework with a temporary database, so they don't affect your development data.

## Code Formatting and Linting

This project uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for code formatting, linting, and import sorting. Common tasks are available via the Makefile:

- `make lint` — Check code for linting and style issues (does not modify files)
- `make fix` — Automatically fix linting issues (including import sorting)
- `make format` — Format code using Ruff's formatter
- `make allfix` — Format code and then auto-fix issues

Run these commands from the `ministerconnect_backend` directory to keep your codebase clean and consistent before committing changes.
