### ⚙️ Services

| Component          | Provider             | Notes                                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Backend API        | Render (Web Service) | Deploys from `main` branch of this repo       |
| PostgreSQL DB      | Render (PostgreSQL)  | Managed database with automatic backups       |
| Media File Storage | AWS S3 Bucket        | Used for candidate profile images and resumes |

### 🔐 Environment Variables

- These are set in the Render Dashboard:

```bash
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret
DATABASE_URL=provided-by-render
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-key
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME=your-aws-region
```

## 🗂️ Media File Handling

- Uploaded media files (e.g., profile photos) are stored in an AWS S3 bucket using django-storages. Ensure the following settings are present in settings.py:

```bash
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = "storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage"
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = os.environ["AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME"]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"]
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"]
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = os.environ.get("AWS_S3_REGION_NAME", "us-east-1")
```
